# TripSync Web Codex Guide

Follow the repository root `AGENTS.md`, then apply the rules below for work inside `tmti_web/`.

## Local PM Routing
- For frontend planning, screen flow design, user stories, UI requirements, or frontend prioritization, read `.codex/agents/pm.md` first.
- Treat that PM file as the default planning role for this subtree.
- In PM mode, do not edit frontend source code unless the user explicitly asks to move into implementation.

## Git Commit Rules
- When frontend work requires a commit, follow the `git-commit-convention` skill.
- Use the commit subject format `type: summary` with skill-aligned prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `ref:`, `style:`, or `test:`.
- Keep the commit message to a simple single-line subject unless the user explicitly asks for more detail.
- Avoid `git add .`; stage only the intended frontend files explicitly.

## Shared Docs
- Consult the relevant shared docs in `../docs/` before frontend planning, implementation, or documentation updates.
- `../docs/PRD.md` - Product requirements, MVP scope, priorities, and core user/problem framing.
- `../docs/TECH_SPEC.md` - Technical design covering frontend, backend, data, infra, and algorithm decisions for the MVP.
